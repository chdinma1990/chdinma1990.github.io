It’s always hard to find what you are passionate about when it comes to choosing a career path. Having a career is all about deriving joy from what you do and doing it to the best of your ability. Some people abandon their four-year college degree to work in their non-field of study. Why? The reason is because, after being on a job for 6 months they realize that they do not enjoy the work they do.

  
For me, right from the beginning I have always wanted to become an accountant but after working a year plus as an accountant, I discovered that looking at the spreadsheets and crunching numbers are not something I would want to do for a long time. However, software development is a lot of fun and I am the kind of person who love to create beautiful things. 

My interest in pursuing software development grew when I first built a blog from scratch on Ruby on rails and also when I built my first website with WordPress and hosted it live with hostgator in January of 2017. 


I derive so much joy in learning software development in the sense that there are moments when I am locked on a particular problem and time seems to slow down and everything else melts away. 


Recently, I have taken some online courses on software development and I loved every bit of learning how to program. I learned that, one can’t be perfect without practice especially when it comes to programming. The more I learn and practice, the better I become in programming. 


I am also learning software development to enable me build and design an accounting software that many with non-accounting skills would find very easy to use.
